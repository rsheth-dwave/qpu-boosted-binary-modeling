Utilizing \cref{eq:ae-training-objective} on \TODO{which dataset?} and then sampling latent codes from the learned QPU$( ;J^\star, h^\star, \theta_\text{ann} )$ yields the results in \Cref{fig:qpu-sampled-image}.

Performing discrete flow matching to learn the ``velocity field'' between 
${\{ z_i \}}_{i=1}^{N}$ and (generated) samples from the learned QPU yields the results in \Cref{fig:flow-matched-qpu-coupled-sampled-image}.
